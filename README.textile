h1. merb_resourceful

merb_resourceful is a plugin similar to resource_controller or make_resourceful for rails.

h2. Usage

Generate a new resource (this will change in the future)

  merb-gen resource my_resource

Edit app/controllers/my_resources.rb and leave the class declaration only

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful
  end

This gives you a basic controller with a few defaults (destroy isn't implemented yet).

h3. Nested resources

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful :belongs_to => :my_parent
    
    # The children will be accessed through parent.[children association]
    # E.g. my_parent.my_resources
    # this will be configurable in the future
    def my_parent
      @foo ||= session.user.parents.get(params[:foo_id])
    end
  end

h3. Scoped resources

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful :scope => :scope_method 
    
    # works just like :parent, but doesn't use @bar for routing
    def scope_method
      @bar ||= session.user.parents.get(params[:bar_id])
    end
  end

h3. Per-action settings

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful do
      index :layout => 'my_special_layout'
      create :scope => :scope_for_create
    end
    
    def scope_for_create
      @baz = get_me!
    end
  end

h3. Param injection

Merb already supports this with the defer_to method in the router, but I think this is way more explicit.

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful do
      index :params => lambda {{ :creator => session.user }} # passes :creator as a param to MyResource.new
      create :params => lambda {{ :creator => session.user }} # passes :creator as a param to the resource's update method
    end
  end

h2. Lots more to come

* More docs
* Implement destroy
