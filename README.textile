h1. merb_resourceful

merb_resourceful is a plugin similar to resource_controller or make_resourceful for rails.

h2. Usage

Generate a new resource (this will change in the future)

  merb-gen resource my_resource

Edit app/controllers/my_resources.rb and leave the class declaration only

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful
  end

This gives you a basic controller with a few defaults (destroy isn't implemented yet).

h3. Nested resources

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful :belongs_to => lambda { ...  }, :as => :parent_instance_var_name # this will change soon, it's ugly
  end

h3. Not nested, but we use a different factory/getter

  This allows you for things like scoping.

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful :parent => lambda { session.user }, :as => :parent_instance_var # same as above
  end

h3. Per-action settings

  class MyResources < Merb::Controller
    resourceful :parent => lambda { session.user }, :as => :parent_instance_var do
      new :parent => lambda { session.parent }
    end
  end

h2. Lots more to come

* More docs
* Simplified usage
* Code cleanup
